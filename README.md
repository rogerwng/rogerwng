## Hi there!! 👋 

I'm an embedded SWE @ Castelion, a hypersonics defense startup. I'm also a Master's of Computer Science Student @ GTech.

I graduated from UCLA with:
- B.S. Aerospace Engineering
- Data Science Engineering minor

I'm super passionate about all things engineering ✈ and machine learning 🧠 - especially in the intersection of the two.  

🛠 **My Languages**: Python, C++, C, MATLAB, HTML/CSS/JS  
🧰 **My Skills**: Embedded Software (STM32 F4/H7, ESP32), Flight SW Valiation (HITL/SIL), ML w/ PyTorch and skLearn, Gen AI w/ Huggingface Diffusers   

Some of my **projects** include:  
- Comprehensive drone 🛸 build with custom avionics stack and flight firmware written in C
- EDA, Classification, and Time Series Analysis of San Francisco 🌉 Police Reports since 2018
- Generative data augmentation to boost classification of small cat 😹 species dataset
- Top scoring MiniPlaces 🖼 classifier using ResNet + EfficientNet ensembles in my Deep Learning class @ UCLA
- Locating Urban Search and Rescue Robot 🤖 w/ Gradient Boosting Trees + IMU

Currently, I'm:
- 🌱 learning ... *app development, drone flight programming*
- 🤔 looking for help with ... *control systems, autonomous vehicles w/ ML*
