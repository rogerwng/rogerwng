## Hi there!! 👋

I recently graduated from UCLA as:
- B.S. Aerospace Engineering
- Data Science Engineering minor

I'm super passionate about all things engineering ✈ and machine learning 🧠 - especially in the intersection of the two.  

🛠 **My Languages**: Python, C++, MATLAB, HTML/CSS/JS  
🧰 **My Skills**: Machine Learning w/ PyTorch and skLearn, Generative AI w/ Huggingface Diffusers, EDA + Visualization w/ Pandas and Matplotlib  

Some of my past **projects** include:
- Generative data augmentation to boost classification of small cat 😹 species dataset
- Top scoring MiniPlaces 🖼 classifier using ResNet + EfficientNet ensembles in my Deep Learning class @ UCLA
- Kaggle competitions (Insurance Cross 📊 Selling + Used Car 🏎 Price)
- Locating Urban Search and Rescue Robot 🤖 w/ Gradient Boosting Trees + IMU

Currently, I'm:
- 🌱 learning ... web development, drone flight programming
- 🤔 looking for help with ... control systems, autonomous vehicles w/ ML
- 🍙 craving ... dumplings, always craving dumplings
